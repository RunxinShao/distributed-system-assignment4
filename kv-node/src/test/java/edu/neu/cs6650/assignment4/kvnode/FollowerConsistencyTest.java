     * <p>This test models the window directly by observing follower state at
     * three points in time:
     * <ol>
     *   <li>Before any replication: GET /local_read returns 404 — the follower
     *       has no data because the leader's W=1 write never propagated here.</li>
     *   <li>During replication: a PUT /kv/internal is started in a background
     *       thread (it sleeps 200 ms before committing).  A concurrent
     *       GET /local_read issued after the request is received but before
     *       the 200 ms delay elapses also returns 404 — the write is still
     *       in-flight and the key is not yet committed.</li>
     *   <li>After replication completes: GET /local_read returns 200 OK with
     *       the correct value, confirming the inconsistency was transient.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * The read delay (50 ms) is less than the write delay (200 ms), so the
     * concurrent read reliably completes and returns before the write commits.
